				<h2>My Self Serve</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>British Columbians who use income and disability assistance services face many day-to-day challenges. For example, in their dealings with government  a simple error could result in a missed benefit payment, with significant implications. To remediate this problem, the individual might then need to make a trip to a Ministry office, possibly hundreds of kilometers away. Considering ways to address this service breakdown, in 2014 the Ministry of Social Development and Social Innovation (SDSII) engaged GCPE’s Service Design Team to gather evidence on how well their services were meeting users’ needs. Through usability research they were able to fix the online channel, My Self Serve (MYSS), so that clients could easily submit applications and other documents online and could access their information 24/7. </p>

				<h3>&gt; Impact</h3>
				<p>Today, benefit recipients receive the flexible, convenient and modern access to our services they have been asking for, leading to peace of mind, as they can proactively check for, and immediately respond to, any issues with upcoming payments - anytime, anywhere.</p>
