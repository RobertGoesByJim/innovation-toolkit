When the BC Public Service is looking for data on the communities we serve, or looking for a way to help a community gain access to international trade, we and the citizens of British Columbia now need look no further than [BritishColumbia.ca](http://www.britishcolumbia.ca/), B.C.'s Trade and Investment website.

While the website is primarily targeted to international investors, it also contains a wealth of information BCPS employees can use to get their jobs done, providing all parties with the tools to investigate and promote investment in communities, including information on local demographics, labour market data, and dynamic and up-to-date community profiles for more than 390 municipalities, regional districts, First Nations and economic regions.
