title: Home Healthcare Monitoring
---

Through a partnership between the Ministry of Health and Telus Health, the Home Health Monitoring Project (HHM) is helping BC citizens living with heart failure to better manage their condition at home through the use of innovative monitoring technology and providing self-management coaching and support.

### Impact

After 3 months on the monitoring program, most clients report improved knowledge about their condition, feel better able to recognize and manage their heart failure symptoms at home, and report improvements in both their physical and mental health status. Evaluation results for the initial HHM programs show a marked decrease in hospital inpatient days (decreased by 76%), a reduction in Emergency Room visits (decreased by 60%) and a decrease in overall health system utilization of 76%.
