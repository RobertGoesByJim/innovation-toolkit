title: Pay BC
---

The PayBC vision is to streamline and standardize payment processes for government, providing one consistent online payment solution for citizens and businesses. With the support of a multi-ministry project advisory committee comprised of representatives from FLNRO, Finance, Justice and MTICS, the project team is currently completing end user testing and working on a proof of concept to provide mobile access and functionality on their platform.

### Impact

Still in-development, when fully built-out PayBC will reduce the number of revenue and account receivable information systems in government and enable the BC Government to have standardization of invoices and accounts, to facilitate a standard payment experience for citizens and businesses, as well as standard processing for government staff.
