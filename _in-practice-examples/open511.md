Each year, DriveBC receives 14 million requests for road and weather conditions of provincial highways. To find travel conditions in municipalities and other provinces and states, users would have to inconveniently access several sources. The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure recognized that if various levels of government opened up their data for sharing, it would enable entrepreneurs to find ways to more conveniently and safely get travellers to their destinations. Open511 is the data standard that can make this idea of "borderless transportation" happen. In 2015, the Ministry collaborated in the development of the standard, and published "DriveBC Open511". The key behind DriveBC Open511 is the API (application programming interface) which offers a standardized way for developers to access the Drive BC data and build innovative apps.

### Impact

The BC tech sector now has the opportunity to partner with government to build apps that save commuters time on roads, reduce accidents, and deliver the best travel experience to our citizens.
