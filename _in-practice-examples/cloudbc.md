title: Cloud BC
---

Cloud computing offers many benefits including: business agility, better time to market, fewer operational issues and less capital expense. Organizations at all levels share common challenges when it comes to getting their services to the cloud. Recognizing this, the BC Council of CIOs (CCIO) - including representatives from the BC Government and Broader Public Sector - developed and launched CloudBC. The intent is to help drive the successful adoption of cloud-based computing services in the BC public sector.

### Impact

While still in early days, CloudBC is aiming to tackle the shared problems described above by establishing a common marketplace for cloud services, sharing knowledge about how to benefit from the cloud, and support cross-jurisdictional collaboration in Canada. The marketplace will standardize approaches to procurement, security, privacy and support education and training to make it simpler for the BC public sector to move into the cloud.
