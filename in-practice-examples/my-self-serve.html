				<h2>My Self Serve</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>British Columbians who use income and disability assistance services face many day-to-day challenges. One of these challenges was that in their dealings with government, a simple error could result in a missed benefit payment. This could then require a trip to a Ministry office, possibly hundreds of kilometers away. So, in 2014, the Ministry of Social Development and Social Innovation (SDSI) considered ways to address this. SDSI engaged GCPE’s Service Design Team to gather evidence on how well their services were meeting the users’ needs. Through usability research they were able to fix the online channel, My Self Serve (MYSS), so that clients could easily submit applications and other documents online and could access their information 24/7.</p>

				<h3>&gt; Impact</h3>
				<p>Today, benefit recipients receive the flexible, convenient and modern access to our services they have been asking for, leading to peace of mind, as they can proactively check for, and immediately respond to, any issues with upcoming payments - anytime, anywhere.</p>
