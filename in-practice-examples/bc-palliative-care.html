			<h2>BC Palliative Care Program</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>When someone close is dying – a parent or grandparent, a husband or wife, a favorite aunt or uncle, you wonder what will happen, you want to give them comfort, you want their wishes to be respected.  The Ministry of Health is committed to ensuring that during end of life, for patients who wish to stay at home, BC Palliative Care support and benefits are delivered as efficiently as possible. Unfortunately, administrative inefficiencies throughout the system were impacting the timely receipt of support and benefits for Palliative Care patients, causing undue stress and, at times, financial hardships.</p>
			<p>By carrying out a collaborative Lean Kaizen workshop amongst stakeholders, the ministry was able to illuminate and address root causes of these process inefficiencies, such as the amount of time spent by all parties on processing and reprocessing enrollment forms. </p>

			<h3>&gt; Impact</h3>
			<p>A Lean approach resulted in the Province’s physicians saving 300,000 hours annually and HIBC reclaiming 70 processing hours annually. Most importantly, palliative care patients and their families, receive the timely benefits and medical supplies they need to be comfortable in their own homes, during the final days of life.</p>
