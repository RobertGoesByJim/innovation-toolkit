# BCGov Innovators Toolkit

The BCGov Innovators Toolkit is the reference repository for digital best practices across our teams. Most of our guides are open source, and you are free to use them as you wish.

Our hope is that other digital service teams, both inside and outside of the BC government, will adopt or modify the practices outlined here.

By developing this material in the open, we hope to encourage expert review and contributions from members of the tech community, furthering our goal of improving how government works through increased civic engagement with tech specialists.
